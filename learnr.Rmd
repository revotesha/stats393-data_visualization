## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will create a (better) visualization for a given data set
which is a record of tornadoes that have happened in the United States 
between 1950 and 2015.

[Original data](https://oasishub.co/dataset/usa-tornado-historical-tracks-noaa/resource/b2a11100-eac5-4d10-869a-87ba064ede2d)

The original visualization of part of this data is two pie charts; one shows the
distribution of the tornadoes by scale and the other shows the distribution of 
tornado-related deaths, also by tornado scale. The pie charts were used by 
'Tornado Project Online' to show that, although tornadoes of scales 4 and 5 are 
rare, they cause more deaths than all the other tornadoes combined.

[See pie charts](http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/fscale.htm)

The tornado scale used here is the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. The EF scale is
based on the damage the tornado causes and it ranges from 0 to 5, with 5 being 
the most violent tornadoes. According to the National Weather Service of the
United  States, the scale of a tornado is determined by first identifying the 
appropriate  damage indicators from a list of 28. For the given indicator,
the degree of  damage is determined from a list of 8. Each degree of damage 
is assigned a  range of wind speed, and it is from these ranges that the scale
is finally decided.

The reason I decided to create a better way to visualize the distribution of
tornadoes and tornado-ralated deaths is because (1) I find it unnessary to use 
3-D (AND exploded) pie charts and I think a regular one-dimensional piechart is
better and, (2) in general, pie charts can be confusing to interpret as they 
don't always present the data in an easily digestible way - it can be hard to 
keep track of the labels and see the relationship of the sizes of the slices
across groups (the several piecharts being compared). 

In this tutorial we will find a better way to visualize the data to show the
intended relationship. We will be working primarily with tidyverse, a collection
of packages that work very well with tidy data. This package and a few others have
been loaded  for you, so you will not have to worry about it.

## Our Goal

We're going to go from having to compare these two separate 3D exploded pie charts ...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/piechart_one.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/piechart_two.png")
```

... to this.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/barchart.png")
```


## Data

To start working with the data, we will need to read it and store it in a variable
so that it's cached.
```{r}
tornadoes = read_excel("Datasets/tornadoes.xls")
```

We can view the first 5 rows to see what the data looks like.
```{r}
head(tornadoes, n = 5)
```

We are only interested in two variables, EF and fat. So we may only want to see
those and not the entire data. EF is the tornado scale described in the introduction
and fat is fatality rate.

```{r}
tornadoes %>% select(EF, fat)
```

The symbol ``%>%`` means 'pass result to'. It is called pipe operator and we will
be using it extensively in this tutorial. Without it, one would need to write the
function as ``select(tornadoes, EF, fat)``. Now, based on this, do you think you can
pipe ``tornadoes %>% select(EF, fat)`` to ``head()`` at the end of the line to 
display just the five five rows? Try it below!

```{r, exercise = TRUE, question-one, exercise.lines = 10}
# careful how many arguements go inside head()!
```

```{r, question-one-solution, echo=FALSE}
tornadoes %>% select(EF, fat) %>% head(n = 5)

# here are several other ways to do it (with or without the pipe operator)
head(tornadoes %>% select(EF, fat), n = 5)
temp = tornadoes %>% select(EF, fat)
head(temp, n = 5)
```

## Visualization: Barplots

### Exploration

To recap our aim, we are trying to show how number of deaths by tornadoes 
varies with the scale of the tornadoe.

Given the nature of the variables, showing this on one single plot will be hard.
The next best thing we could do is put two plot objects together as one plot.

```{r, question-two, echo=F}
question(
  "Why do you think we want to have both graphs in one place? Pick the best answer",
  answer("To save space"),
  answer("So it's easier to compare trends", correct = TRUE),
  answer("So it's fancier"),
  answer("Because we like long code")
  )
```

First we will explore the two variables separately and pick something we can 
enventually use. There are a limited number of ways to visualize categorical
variables. In our case, the only ways that make sense for EF are piecharts and
barplots. Since the website already used piecharts, we will use barplots
for both variables.

We will be using the ggplot function from ggplot2 for plotting.

```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Above, we started with a call to ``ggplot()``. This creates space for our graph that we can
then work on. Inside the function, we specify the data to be used (data has to be in a
tibble format) and the aesthetics. Aesthetics is what goes inside ``aes()``. It is how you
map your variables to visual properties of the plot. The plotting itself is done by
the geom ``geom_bar()``. Try implement a similar plot for number of fatalities, fat. Notice
that while EF was ordinal (or rather, we will consider it to be), fat is discrete.
We will therefore want to use a histogram instead of a bargraph. The code has been 
started for you.

```{r graph-one, exercise = TRUE, echo=FALSE, exercise.lines = 10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(___ , ___) + 
  ___ +
  xlim(x = c(-1, 25))
```

```{r graph-one-solution}
ggplot(data = tornadoes, aes(x = fat)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(x = c(-1, 25))
```

What do you think ``xlim()`` does? Try remove it from you solution and see if there 
is a difference.

```{r, question-three, echo=F}
question(
  "What do you think xlim does?",
  answer("Calculates the limit of x"),
  answer("Removes the x-axis label"),
  answer("Specifies the range of x values", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Doesn't do anything")
)
```

### Set-up

Since each tornado is assigned one scale, our first plot already tells you
the distribution of tornado by tornado scale. We will need something more similar to this
for fatalities plot than we have now. To do this, we will first manipulate the data
a little bit. We will calculate the expectation of deaths for each
tornado scale. This can also be thought of as the mean number of deaths per
tornado. To do this, we will have to play with the data a little bit. We will
group the data by scale (using ``group_by()``) and calculate the mean of ``fat``
for each group (using ``summarize()``). Partial code for this is provided below.
Fill in the missing bits using our data and the pipe operator.

```{r include=FALSE}
deaths_per_sc = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat))
```

```{r question-four, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
deaths_per_sc =  ___  ___
  group_by(EF) ___
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat))
```

```{r question-four-solution}
deaths_per_sc = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat))
```

It is worth noting that ``summarize()`` only returns what you grouped by and
what you are summarizing. So the rest of the data disappears.

```{r, question-five, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
# write the code to display deaths_per_sc. It will be helpful to see it.
```

Lets now use ``deaths_per_sc`` to make another barplot. Notice we now need to
have a different y-axis and not just leave it to R to use count. Complete the code
and set ``y = mean_deaths_per_sc`` in ``aes()``.

```{r graph-two, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
___ +
___(stat = "identity") +
labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths per EF Scale", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
theme_classic() +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5"))
```

```{r graph-two-solution}
ggplot(data = deaths_per_sc, aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths per EF Scale", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
theme_classic() +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5"))
```

In the code, ``labs()`` lets us add labels for x and y axes and title for the graph.
``theme_classic()`` is one of the several themes you can use for your plot. 
The other theme you have seen is the default ``theme_grey()``. ``theme()`` lets
you modify or style the axes (labels, ticks, or grid lines etc.), the title and 
more. It is a way to customize parts of plot that are not dependent on data. 
In the code above, for example, ``theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))``
adjusts the hotizontal postion of the plot title to center it. You can add more options
provided you separate them by commas. ``scale_x_continuous()`` lets us define our
breaks for x-axis. Other variants of this include ``scale_y_continuous()``, and the
discrete versions. Type ``?scale_y_discrete`` in your console to learn more.

```{r, question-six, echo=F}
question(
  "If we change hjust = 0.5 to hjust = 0, where in the plot do you think the title
  of the plot will be displayed?",
  answer("Top-right"),
  answer("Top-left", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Bottom-right"),
  answer("Bottom-left")
)
```

```{r graph-three, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
# using the new functions you've seen in the previous exercise, update the plot
# for EF. y-axis will be the default count this time. ggplot2 is grouping by EF
# and count number of tornadoes in each group.
```

```{r graph-three-solution}
ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale", x = "Scale (0 - 5)") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5"))
```

### Putting it together

We will now put the two plots together to have one plot object. The plot object
is diverging barplots. To get there, we will need to flip the coordinate system for
both graphs and reverse the direction bars on one, so that the bars for each plot 
are pointing in the opposite directions. We will call the plot pointing to the right
``right_plot`` and the other ``left_plot``. The two plots will share the same
x-axis (which will be vertical after flipping the coordinates), so one will not
have x-axis label and ticks.

Below is the code for this. Change the theme to ``theme_bw`` and remove the
grid lines that appear on the plots. After that, change the color to something 
else for each plot. While trying to remove grid lines, know that a plot may have
both major and minor grid lines and you need to account for both in your code. You
will need to use both ``panel.grid.major`` and ``panel.grid.minor``. Set these to
``element_blank()``.

```{r include=FALSE}
right_plot = ggplot(data = deaths_per_sc, aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "deepskyblue4") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Deaths per EF Scale\n", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0   ", "EF1   ", "EF2   ", "EF3   ", "EF4   ",
                                "EF5   ")) +
  coord_flip()

left_plot = ggplot(data = tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "firebrick4") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Tornado Count by Scale", y = "Tornado Count\n", x = NULL) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r prepare-graph-four, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 20}
right_plot = ggplot(data = deaths_per_sc, aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "black") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Deaths per EF Scale\n", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0   ", "EF1   ", "EF2   ", "EF3   ", "EF4   ",
                                "EF5   ")) +
  coord_flip()

left_plot = ggplot(data = tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Tornado Count by Scale", y = "Tornado Count\n", x = NULL) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r prepare-graph-four-solution}
right_plot = ggplot(data = deaths_per_sc, aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "deepskyblue4") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Deaths per EF Scale\n", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0   ", "EF1   ", "EF2   ", "EF3   ", "EF4   ",
                                "EF5   ")) +
  coord_flip()
  
left_plot = ggplot(data = tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "firebrick4") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Tornado Count by Scale", y = "Tornado Count\n", x = NULL) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip()
```

Play with ``scale_x_continuous()`` a litle bit. What happens if you change the 
strings in the parameter ``labels``? What happens if you remove the spaces in the
labels (for example "EF0" instead of "EF     0")?

```{r, question-seven, echo=F}
question(
  "Would we want to change the order of the strings in the list 'labels', the
  parameter for 'scale_x_continuous'?",
  answer("We could because order doesn't matter"),
  answer("Order doesn't matter but we want to order them so they match the values in 'breaks'",
         correct = TRUE),
  answer("We don't even need that part of code!")
)
```


``grid.arrange()`` combines the plots. We are going to use the plots generated by
the solution code from the previous exercise. If you want, you can copy this code
and run it in that exercise chunk to have it generate the plots with your changes.

```{r}
grid.arrange(left_plot, right_plot, ncol = 2,
             top = textGrob("Though Fewer, the More Violent Tornadoes \n Cause More Deaths per Tornado\n",
gp = gpar(fontsize = 10, font = 1)))
```

## Visualizaton: Piecharts

If you still prefer pie charts, here is a better way to use piecharts with this
data.

First, we make a data frame containing a column with mean death for each EF scale. 
Try do this. Hint: we did this when creating a barplot for fatalities.

```{r include=FALSE}
mean_deaths = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat)) %>%
  mutate(EF = as.factor(EF)) #paste0("EF", EF))
```

```{r question-eight, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r question-eight-solution}
mean_deaths = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat)) %>%
  mutate(EF = as.factor(EF)) # we need to change EF to type factor to discretize
# coloring later on.
```

We then create another data frame with the number of tornadoes for each scale. 
This should be somewhat similar to creating expectation of number of fatalities
for each scale. See if you can figure out the code. We will later need to bind
the two data frames, so we can't have repeating columns. Use a pipe operator
and ``select(-EF)`` to remove the column.

```{r include=FALSE}
n_tornadoes = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(num_tornadoes_per_sc = n()) %>%
  select(-EF)
```

```{r question-nine, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10}

```

```{r question-nine-solution}
n_tornadoes = tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(num_tornadoes_per_sc = n()) %>%
  select(-EF)
```

In the code below, we do a column bind on the two data frames. We then change
the resulting data frame to obtain a long data format. We will gather means and 
number of tornadoes for each scale into one column and have a corresponding
column that helps us (or rather, the computer) what those values came from. We will
call the column with values ``values`` and the other ``quantity``. The columns
``mean_deaths_per_sc`` and ``num_tornadoes_per_sc`` are coming from ``mean_deaths`` 
data frame and ``n_tornadoes`` respectively. We then use a mutate function to
change ``mean_deaths_per_sc`` to ``Average Deaths by Scale`` and ``num_tornadoes_per_sc`` 
to ``Tornado Count by Scale``. Why do you think we are doing the last step? Hint:
look at the titles for the pie charts.

```{r}
both = cbind(mean_deaths, n_tornadoes) %>%
  gather(quantity, values, mean_deaths_per_sc, num_tornadoes_per_sc) %>%
  mutate(quantity = ifelse(quantity == "mean_deaths_per_sc",
                           "Average Deaths by Scale", 
                           "Tornado Count by Scale"))
```

```{r question-ten, exercise=TRUE}
# see what the data frame from the previous code looks like.
```

Below is the code the generates the pie charts. Read through it and try to
understand what the different parts do. ``scale_fill_viridis`` is a color palette
function -- we have five categories we want to color and this picks the colors
for us. Inside this function, we have set ``discrete`` to ``TRUE`` to discretize
the colors. If you changed this to ``FALSE``, you would get an error because we
previously changed ``EF`` to be of type factor.

```{r}
ggplot(data = both, aes(x = 1, y = values, fill = EF)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  facet_wrap(~quantity) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + # could also have used
  # scale_fill_viridis_d(). d is for discretized values.
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank())
```

Unlike on the website, these piecharts are drawn side by side, have colors that 
match and they share the same legendand. It is easier to compare this way.

## Conclusion
Compared to the original charts, both results make it easier to compare the 
number of tornadoes by scale with the number of deaths for each scale. In my
opinion, the barplots make this even easier as the bars are paired and are back
to back. One can clearly see that, tornado count is highest for scale EF0 tornadoes,
but the corresponding bar for deaths per EF scale is negligibly small. The reverse
is true for EF5.

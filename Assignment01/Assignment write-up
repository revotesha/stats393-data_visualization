Assignment 01 Write-up:

The aim of this assignment was to write code that connects to a survey to
analyse and visualize data that's been provided by the surveyed population.
To do this, we used Rstudios's R markdown to write the analysis and visualization 
code and used google forms to gather data.

We started with creating the google form. This contained eight questions targeted at 
fifth grade girls participating in FEMMES data visualization workshop here at Duke
University. For variability, these questions gathered both categorical and
numeric data. We then created a google sheet to store the responses to these questions. 
In an R markdown file, we implemented the code for analysing and visuazing the survey data.
In the code, we used a package called googlesheets to link the google sheet with 
the R markdown file.

For the visualizions, we included two scatter plots to visualize correlation between two
variables. These two plots were meant to show FEMMES workshop participants the
the difference betweeen correlated and uncorrelated data. We also included two bar
plots to show how one can visualize categorical data and also illustrate 
to students cool things one can do in R, for example changing the color of individual 
bars to virtually any color one prefers. Lastly, we included one animated plot to
show students that it is also possible to animate visualizations in R.

In this assingment, I will be working to create what I think is a better 
visualization for a dataset. The dataset I will be working with is a record of
tornadoes that have happened in the United States between 1950 and 2015. 
The name of the dataset is 'tornadoes'. The original dataset (linked below) 
contains more variables that are not relevent for this assignment.

-noaa/resource/b2a11100-eac5-4d10-869a-87ba064ede2d

The original visualization of part of this data is two pie charts; one shows the
distribution of the tornadoes by scale and the other shows the distribution of 
tornado-related deaths, also by tornado scale. The pie charts were used by 
'Tornado Project Online' to show that, although tornadoes of scales 4 and 5 are 
rare, they cause more deaths than all the other tornadoes combined.

Link to the charts: http://www.tornadoproject.com/cellar/fscale.htm 

Below are screenshots of the pie charts as they appeared on the site on 
February 7, 2019.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("tornadoesImage01.png", dpi = NA)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("tornadoesImage02.png", dpi = NA)
```

The tornado scale used here is the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. The EF scale is
based on the damage the tornado causes and it ranges from 0 to 5, with 5 being 
the most violent tornadoes. According to the National Weather Service of the
United  States, the scale of a tornado is determined by first identifying the 
appropriate  damage indicators from a list of 28. For a given indicator,
the degree of  damage is determined from a list of 8. Each degree of damage 
is assigned a  range of wind speed, and it is from these ranges that the scale
is finally decided.

The reason I decided to create a better way to visualize the distribution of
tornadoes and tornado-ralated deaths is because (1) I find it unnessary to use 
3-D (AND exploded) pie charts and I think a regular one-dimensional piechart is
better but (2) in general, pie charts can be confusing to interpret and they 
don't always present the data in an easily digestible way - it can be hard to 
keep track of the labels (often there is labelling for percentages and for the 
different groups involved) and seeing the relationship between the different 
size of the pieces  of the chart and the groups. 

My idea of a better visualization is the use of a bar graph. Below is one that 
shows the percentage of tornadoes by scale.
```{r}
#loading the data.
tornadoes <- read_xls("tornadoes.xls")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) + geom_bar(aes(x = EF))
```

The bar graph above has count on the y-axis. The one below has percentages - 
this will make it easier to see the distribution of the different tornadoes 
as far as scale is concerned.

```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = EF, y = ..prop..)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + 
  ylab("Percentage") 
```

To make it even easier to see the distribution, I will add percentages at the 
top of the individual bars. See below.
```{R}
ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..), 
  stat = "count", vjust = -.2, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + ylab("Percentage")
```

Now I will give the graph a title, more descriptive axes labels and some colors
to make it more visually appealing.

```{R}
tornadoes_plot = ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge(),
  fill = "maroon") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..), 
  stat= "count", vjust = -.2, position =     position_dodge(.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  ylab("Percentage") + 
  labs(title = "Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale", x = "Scale (0 - 5)") + 
  theme_light() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
tornadoes_plot
```

To visualize the percentage of tornado-related deaths, I will first create a
table that groups deaths by EF scales. I will then use this table to create a 
scatter plot of EF scale vs deaths.

```{r}
deaths = tornadoes %>% group_by(EF) %>% summarise(deaths = sum(fat))
deaths
```

```{r}
deaths_plot = ggplot(deaths, aes(x = EF, y = deaths)) + 
  geom_count() + 
  theme_light() + 
  labs(title = "Deaths vs. Scale", x = "Scale (0 - 5)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
deaths_plot
```

Below are the two graphs plotted side by side. On the left (percentage of
tornadoes by scale), it can be seen that as the scale increases, the number of
tornadoes decreases. On the right (deaths vs scale), it can be seen that, in
general, deaths increase with scale. I think it is now easier to actually
visualize the trend for both graphs - one can see an increase or a decrease and
does not have to always have to keep track of labels to be able to understand 
what is happening (once one sees the the graphs, they don't need to keep
going back to the labels to understand the graphs).

```{r}
grid.arrange(tornadoes_plot, deaths_plot, ncol = 2)
```


Working on suggestions from Dr. Mine Çentinkaya:

In the graph below, I flipped the axes to have a horizontal bar graph that is
better visually and is easier to read. Besides the axes, I also removed 
unnecessary labels on the now y-axis (after flipping) and added more descriptive 
labels on the now x-axis. It is the graph of Perentage of Tornadoes by Scale.

```{r}
tornadoes_plot1 = ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge(),
  fill = "maroon") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..),
  stat= "count", hjust = -.1, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,0.5), breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_flip()
tornadoes_plot1
```


The graph below is also horizontal but has all the labels on the axes and
does not have percentages on the individual bars. It is the graph of Counts
of Tornadoe-related Deaths by Scale. This is a bar graph of two variables 
(as opposed to one variable vs counts of tornadoes in the previsous one)
so it is hard to get the y-axis to behave the same as that in the previous  
graph. So I will leave it like that for now.

```{r}
tornadoes_plot2 = ggplot(data = tornadoes) + 
geom_bar(aes(x = EF, y = fat), stat="identity", fill = "maroon") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) +
labs(title = "Counts of Tornadoe-related Deaths by \n Scale", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,2500)) +
theme_light() +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
coord_flip()
tornadoes_plot2
```

It was suggested that I plot EF agains death rate (number of deaths per tornado)
to get a different graph. I was not able to do this. The variable fat in the
dataset is the number of deaths per tornado, so it is already a death rate. That
way, the graph below is already a distribution of tornado scale by death rate.

I tried different ways to show the relationship between EF and death keeping in
in mind all the suggestions, and I have not found one that looks better than the
one below. The ones I have tried looked very weird and hard to interpret. I also
tried to find a way to put the the information in the pie charts in one graph and
this was not successful too.

So given the challenges, I decided to just leave both graphs as horizontal bar
charts for now. Below, the graphs are presented side by side. One can see that 
as the intensity of a tornado increases (on the left), number of tornadoes decreases,
but the number of deaths by tornadoes increases. This is what the two 
were trying to show, but now on bar graphs.

```{r}
grid.arrange(tornadoes_plot1, tornadoes_plot2, ncol = 2)
```


#### Edit (February 11):

I was able to figure out how to show all the information in one chart. I grouped
deaths by EF scale, calculated mean deaths for each scale and plotted EF 
scale against its mean. This can also be thought of as deaths per tornado.
It seems like it is what a previous suggestion about plotting EF vs death rate 
meant (it is - updated February 20). Below is the graph.

```{r}
tornadoes %>%
  
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat)) %>%
  
  ggplot(data = .) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc), stat = "identity", fill = "maroon") +
  labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths per EF Scale", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) +
  coord_flip()
```

Correction: the plot of Average Deaths by Scale above still doesn not show the
information from both of the pie charts. It is just showing the expected death
for each tornado given it's EF scale.

While creating the plot, I thought of boxplots. A boxplot could show the same
information. I tried to plot one.

```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = EF, y = fat, group = EF)) +
  labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths", title = "Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,30))

#scale_y_continuous(limits = ...) will remove data that fall outside the limits 
#and then perform the statistical calculations so the mean and other summaries 
#will be affected. The alternative is to use coord_cartesian(limits = ...) - this 
#'zooms' in without removing data or affecting the summaries.
```

The boxplot above indeed shows the same information. It is however hard to see where
the means for the lower scales are. I have tried zooming in as much as possible, and
I can only see two means, for EF4 and EF5.

To show information from both pie-charts, I will go back to two side by side
graphs. This time, however, I will use the Average Deaths by Scale and a version
of the Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale graph. Moreover, the graphs will be
diverging away from each other - giving a diverging bar chart with a shared central 
axis. I use the Average Deaths by Scale graph and not Counts of Tornadoe-related 
Deaths by Scale graph  because  it shows the increasing trend in deaths by 
tornado scale better. The Average Deaths by Scale graph corrects the problem 
that a given scale can have more deaths just because there were many tornadoes 
of that scale.

In the code below, I am re-doing the Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale graph. The
new graph will not use percentage and will not have numbers stacked on the bar.
The reason I am changing to counts instead of using percentages is because I think
the use of percentages (in this particular case) is unnecessary - we can get an
idea of how the tornadoes are ditributed by EF scale by looking at the size of the
bars. If one wants to know the exact number of tornadoes of a given scale,
they can get that information from the y-axis that now has tornado counts.

```{r}
tornadoes_left = ggplot(data = tornadoes) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = EF), fill = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") + 
  labs(title = "Tornado Count by Scale", y = "Tornado Count\n", x = NULL) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  coord_flip()
```

I am also redoing the Average Deaths by Scale graph just so I can easily merge
the two graphs later on. For both graphs, I will change fill color just to have
a combination that works well.

```{r}
tornadoes_right <- tornadoes %>%
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat)) %>%
  
  ggplot(data = .) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc), stat = "identity", fill = "red") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Deaths per EF Scale\n", title = "Average Deaths by Scale") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0   ", "EF1   ", "EF2   ", "EF3   ", "EF4   ",
                                "EF5   ")) +
  coord_flip()
```

Merging the graphs:
```{r}
grid.arrange(tornadoes_left, tornadoes_right, ncol = 2, top = textGrob("\nThough 
             Fewer, the More Violent Tornadoes Cause More Deaths per Tornado\n", 
             gp = gpar(fontsize = 15, font = 1)))
```

And this will be my final graph for now. It clearly shows the information from
the two pie charts.

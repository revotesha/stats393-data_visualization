In this assingment, I will be working to create what I think is a better 
visualization for a dataset. The dataset I will be working with is a record of
tornadoes that have happened in the United States between 1950 and 2015. 
The name of the dataset is 'tornadoes'. The original dataset (linked below) 
contains more variables that are not relevent for this assignment.

The original visualization of part of this data is two piecharts; one shows the
distribution of the tornadoes by scale and the other shows the distribution of 
tornado-related deaths, also by tornado scale. The piecharts were used by 
'Tornado Project Online' to show that, although tornadoes of scales 4 and 5 are 
rare, they cause more deaths than all the other tornadoes combined.

Below are screenshots of the piecharts as they appeared on the site on 
February 7, 2019.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("tornadoesImage01.png", dpi = NA)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("tornadoesImage02.png", dpi = NA)
```

The tornado scale used here is the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. The EF scale is
based on the damage the tornado causes and it ranges from 0 to 5, with 5 being 
the most violent tornadoes. According to the National Weather Service of the
United  States, the scale of a tornado is determined by first identifying the 
appropriate  damage indicators from a list of 28. For a given indicator,
the degree of  damage is determined from a list of 8. Each degree of damage 
is assigned a  range of wind speed, and it is from these ranges that the scale
is finally decided.

The reason I decided to create a better way to visualize the distribution of
tornadoes and tornado-ralated deaths is because (1) I find it unnessary to use 
3-D (AND exploded) piecharts and I think a regular one-dimensional piechart is
better but (2) in general, piecharts can be confusing to interpret and they 
don't always present the data in an easily digestible way - it can be hard to 
keep track of the labels (often there is labelling for percentages and for the 
different groups involved) and seeing the relationship between the different 
size of the pieces  of the chart and the groups. 

My idea of a better visualization is the use of a bar graph. Below is one that 
shows the percentage of tornadoes by scale.
```{r}
#loading the data.
tornadoes <- read_excel("tornadoes.xls")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) + geom_bar(aes(x = EF))
```

The bar graph above has count on the y-axis. The one below has percentages - 
this will make it easier to see the distribution of the different tornadoes 
as far as scale is concerned.

```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = EF, y = ..prop..)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + 
  ylab("Percentage") 
```

To make it even easier to see the distribution, I will add percentages at the 
top of the individual bars. See below.
```{R}
ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..), 
  stat = "count", vjust = -.2, position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + ylab("Percentage")
```

Now I will give the graph a title, more descriptive axes labels and some colors
to make it more visually appealing.

```{R}
tornadoes_plot = ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge(),
  fill = "maroon") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..), 
  stat= "count", vjust = -.2, position =     position_dodge(.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  ylab("Percentage") + 
  labs(title = "Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale", x = "Scale (0 - 5)") + 
  theme_light() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
tornadoes_plot
```

To visualize the percentage of tornado-related deaths, I will first create a
table that groups deaths by EF scales. I will then use this table to create a 
scatter plot of EF scale vs deaths.

```{r}
deaths = tornadoes %>% group_by(EF) %>% summarise(deaths = sum(fat))
deaths
```

```{r}
deaths_plot = ggplot(deaths, aes(x = EF, y = deaths)) + 
  geom_count() + 
  theme_light() + 
  labs(title = "Deaths vs. Scale", x = "Scale (0 - 5)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
deaths_plot
```

Below are the two graphs plotted side by side. On the left (percentage of
tornadoes by scale), it can be seen that as the scale increases, the number of
tornadoes decreases. On the right (deaths vs scale), it can be seen that, in
general, deaths increase with scale. I think it is now easier to actually
visualize the trend for both graphs - one can see an increase or a decrease and
does not have to always have to keep track of labels to be able to understand 
what is happening (once one sees the the graphs, they don't need to keep
going back to the labels to understand the graphs).

```{r}
grid.arrange(tornadoes_plot, deaths_plot, ncol = 2)
```


Working on suggestions from Dr. Mine Ã‡entinkaya:

In the graph below, I flipped the axes to have a horizontal bar graph that is
better visually and is easier to read. Besides the axes, I also removed 
unnecessary labels on the now y-axis (after flipping) and added more descriptive 
labels on the now x-axis. It is the graph of Perentage of Tornadoes by Scale.

```{r}
tornadoes_plot1 = ggplot(tornadoes, aes(x = EF)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..), stat="count", position = position_dodge(),
  fill = "maroon") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(..prop..,3)), y = ..prop..),
  stat= "count", hjust = -.1, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0,0.5), breaks = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Tornadoes by Scale", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_flip()
tornadoes_plot1
```


The graph below is also horizontal but has all the labels on the axes and
does not have percentages on the individual bars. It is the graph of Counts
of Tornadoe-related Deaths by Scale. This is a bar graph of two variables 
(as opposed to one variable vs counts of tornadoes in the previsous one)
so it is hard to get the y-axis to behave the same as that in the previous  
graph. So I will leave it like that for now.

```{r}
tornadoes_plot2 = ggplot(data = tornadoes) + 
geom_bar(aes(x = EF, y = fat), stat="identity", fill = "maroon") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                   labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5")) +
labs(title = "Counts of Tornadoe-related Deaths by \n Scale", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,2500)) +
theme_light() +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
coord_flip()
```

It was suggested that I plot EF agains death rate (number of deaths per tornado)
to get a different graph. I was not able to do this. The variable fat in the
dataset is the number of deaths per tornado, so it is already a death rate. That
way, the graph below is already a distribution of tornado scale by death rate.

I tried different ways to show the relationship between EF and death keeping in
in mind all the suggestions, and I have not found one that looks better than the
one below. The ones I have tried looked very weird and hard to interpret. I also
tried to find a way to put the the information in the piecharts in one graph and
this was not successful too.

So given the challenges, I decided to just leave both graphs as horizontal bar
charts for now. Below, the graphs are presented side by side. One can see that 
as the intensity of a tornado increases (on the left), number of tornadoes decreases,
but the number of deaths by tornadoes increases. This is what the two piecharts
were trying to show, but now on bar graphs.

```{r}
grid.arrange(tornadoes_plot1, tornadoes_plot2, ncol = 2)
```


### Edit (February 11):

I was able to figure out how to show all the information in one chart. I grouped
deaths by EF scale, calculated mean deaths for each scale and plotted EF 
scale against the mean. This seems like it is what a previous suggestion about
plotting EF vs death rate meant. Below is the graph.

```{r}
tornadoes %>%
  
  group_by(EF) %>%
  summarize(mean_deaths_per_sc = mean(fat)) %>%
  
  ggplot(data = .) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = EF, y = mean_deaths_per_sc), stat = "identity", fill = "maroon") +
  labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths per EF Scale", title = "Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5"))
```






```{r}
ggplot(data = tornadoes) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = EF, y = fat, group = EF)) +
  labs(x = "EF Scale", y = "Deaths", title = "Deaths by Scale") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                     labels = c("EF0", "EF1", "EF2", "EF3", "EF4", "EF5"))
```


Actaully these two still do not show both info. The last one though shows both deaths per scale and mean of deaths for each
scale - that is, the expecation of number of deaths if an EF 5 hits is about 20 (which is also what the previous one means).
